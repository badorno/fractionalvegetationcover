# About

This tutorial and javascript allow Google Earth Engine users to calculate Fractional Vegetation Cover based on scaled NDVI squared [(Carlson; Ripley 1997)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425797001041) and refine the result through a resampling interactive process (Figure 1).

# How to use

<h4>1. You need access to the code editor website. If you are a first time user, follow the steps described bellow </h4> 

[getting started at code editor in Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/quickstart_javascript)


<h4>2. Getting the code</h4>

Once you have started your code editor, access the [repository](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Fbrunoadornoflorestal%2Ffractionalvegetationcover%3AFr_refined) directly in Google Earth Engine. The repository will appear at <b>Reader Session</b> of your scripts tab.

<h4>3. Watch the lecture introducing important concepts to calculate urban fractional vegetation cover </h4>

a - Remote sensing in urbanized areas
b - Normalized Vegetation Index calculation
c - Fr calculation
d - Comparing Fr and NDVI

<h4>4. Watch the video tutorial explaining how the script works </h4>

<h4>5. Watch the video tutorial explaining how to use the code to calculate the fractional vegetation cover </h4>


<h4>Enjoy!</h4>
